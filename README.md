# Intro
This repo shows a demo of processing large dataset with Pandas. Packages "pandarallel" and "multiprocessing" are used for parallelization. In a few not so rigorous trials, pandarallel achieves slightly better performance.

## Usage
<pre>
git clone
cd into the directory
python3 generate_dataset.py
bash main.sh
</pre>

htop can be used to monitor the resource usage
